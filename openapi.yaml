    ## Authentication
    Dployr uses JWT-based authentication with access and refresh tokens:
    
    ### Token Types
    - **Access Token**: Short-lived (10 minutes) for API requests
    - **Refresh Token**: Long-lived (24+ hours) for obtaining new access tokens
    
    ### Authentication Flow
    1. Login with `/auth/request` to get both tokens
    2. Use access token in Authorization header: `Authorization: Bearer <access-token>`
    3. When access token expires, use `/auth/refresh` with refresh token
    
    ## Authorization
    Role-based access control with four levels:
    - **Owner**: Full system control, can manage admins
    - **Admin**: Infrastructure management, user management, secrets
    - **Developer**: Deploy apps, view logs and events
    - **Viewer**: Read-only access to services
